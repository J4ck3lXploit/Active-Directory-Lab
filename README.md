💻 **Active-Directory-Lab**  
🚀 In this project, I:  

- Set up **Active Directory** with a **Domain Controller** and configured **users** within **OU**
- Installed and configured **Splunk** for log analysis and **Sysmon** for security monitoring 🛡️  
- Configured **group policies**, implemented **security measures**, and tested a **brute force attack** 🔓   

📂 Check out the lab to see how I built a fully functional Active Directory environment!
