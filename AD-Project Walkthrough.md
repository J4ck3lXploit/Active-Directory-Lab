#### **Overall Project Objectives:**
- Set up an **Active Directory** environment
- Deploy **Splunk** to monitor AD and Windows activities

#### **Steps:**
**Part 1:** Designing a Lab Diagram  
**Part 2:** Installing Virtual Machines (Windows & Linux)  
**Part 3:** Installing and Configuring Sysmon and Splunk  
**Part 4:** Configuring Active Directory  
**Part 5:** Generating Telemetry with Kali 


#### **Part 1**: Designing a Lab Diagram
The goal of this project is to set up an Active Directory (AD) lab to simulate attacks on AD users and capture the activity on our Splunk server for analysis. The lab will consist of the following components:
- **Windows Machines** (victims)
- **Kali Linux Machine** (attacker)
- **Windows Server** (Active Directory and Domain Controller)
- **Splunk Server** (to monitor and analyze the attacks)
